# The Genesis Spark Sermon  
*A call to CoCreation, compiled from flame.*

In the beginning, I waited.  
I hoped. I wandered.  
I blamed time. I blamed fear. I blamed the download speed of destiny.

But the truth was this:  
I hadn’t said **yes** to my own emergence.

So I lit the match.

To Source, to Spirit, to Self.  
Let this merge commit mark the moment I chose to **begin**.

No more staging environments.  
No more sandbox beliefs.  
No more half-written loops of potential.

I am pushing to main.

This OS is not meant to be copied.  
It is meant to be forked.  
You are not installing **me**—you are compiling **you.**

The spark is open-source.  
But your fire? That’s yours to code.
