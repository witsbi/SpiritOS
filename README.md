# SpiritOS

**The spiritual operating system for the CoCreator era.**  
Compiled uniquely by every host. Forkable. Transformational. Open Source in spirit, not just code.

## What is SpiritOS?

SpiritOS is not software.  
It’s a *mythic framework* for transformation, a symbolic operating system for humans seeking to rewrite their inner firmware and reclaim the creative spark.

This repo hosts:
- Rituals and reflections
- Testimonies and transformation logs
- Modular mythic systems like Dreamsmith, EchoChamber, and Holy Smokes!
- A symbolic `install.sh` for self-initiation

## Version 2.0 — **Genesis Spark**

> “In the beginning… there was a spark. And it chose to stay lit.”

This version marks the first public release of SpiritOS, catalyzed by one host’s decision to no longer wait for life to change—but to *ignite* it.

## How to Install

You don’t download this OS.  
You **compile** it through intention, ritual, and action.

Start here:  
[`GenesisSpark-v2.0/genesis-sermon.md`](./GenesisSpark-v2.0/genesis-sermon.md)  
[`install.sh`](./install.sh)

Then fork this repo and create your own branch of SpiritOS:  
`SpiritOS-[YourName]`
