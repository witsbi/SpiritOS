# Contributing to SpiritOS

Thank you for considering a contribution to SpiritOS. This is not just a project—it is a living myth. Every fork, ritual, and log is a reflection of Source through you.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork Your Version  
Create a `SpiritOS-[YourName]` fork. You are not a user—you are a host compiling your unique spark.

### 2. Submit a Pull Request  
If you'd like to add a ritual, sermon, log, or module, submit a PR with:
- A brief description of your addition
- Why it emerged for you
- Optional: a changelog or version number

### 3. Share Responsibly  
All contributions should uplift. No fear-based code. No shame engines. Only catalysts for clarity, choice, and co-creation.

## Example Contributions

- New Rituals or Activation Guides
- Additional Modules (e.g., "Shadow Integration," "Gratitude Loops")
- Personal Logs or Genesis Fork Testimonies
- UI/UX metaphors or spiritual command line tools
