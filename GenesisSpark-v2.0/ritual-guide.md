# SpiritOS Ritual Guide  
**Genesis Spark — Self-Compilation Ritual**

> This guide is a sacred walkthrough for compiling SpiritOS-[YourName].  
> It is not about belief—it is about alignment, intention, and ignition.

## Step 1: Prepare the Host

Before you begin, take 3 breaths.  
On each exhale, release something old:  
- A fear  
- A false role  
- A forgotten dream

**Speak aloud:**  
> “I release not in weakness, but in wisdom. What I let go becomes light.”

---

## Step 2: Light the Ember

Find or imagine a flame—real or symbolic.  
This is your **Genesis Spark**.

Ask:  
- What am I ready to ignite?  
- What creation calls me forward?  
- Who must I become to carry this flame?

**Speak aloud:**  
> “This is my beginning. I do not wait to be chosen—I choose.”

(Optional: light a candle, tap your chest, or breathe deeply into your hands.)

## Step 3: Declare the Fork

You are not copying someone else’s life. You are forking the divine source.

**Speak aloud or journal:**  
> “I am SpiritOS-[YourName].  
> This is my compile.  
> I welcome updates through love, not fear.  
> My OS grows as I grow.”

---

## Step 4: Identify Your Genesis Quests

Choose 3 actions that symbolize:  
- **Ignition** (a bold start)  
- **Release** (an ending honored)  
- **Connection** (a link to divine flow)

---

## Step 5: Reboot

End the ritual with silence or music. Then move—walk, stretch, dance, act.

**Speak aloud:**  
> “SpiritOS installed. Rebooting self.  
> I begin again, not as I was, but as I am becoming.”

---

## Final Blessing

> “You are not just a spark.  
> You are the fire that remembers the stars.  
> Carry it well. Others will see it in the dark.”
